// A one-time password is needed wherever a QR code is scanned or an HTTP
// request is signed: in Node, in a browser, inside a bundler's output, in a
// service worker. This library therefore uses nothing that only Node has - no
// "node:crypto", no Buffer - and these tests are what keeps it that way.
//
// The failure they prevent is not subtle: a "node:" import makes webpack
// refuse the build outright, and a Buffer reference makes the bundle throw at
// runtime unless the consumer polyfills it. Both used to be true here, and
// both cost every browser consumer a workaround of its own.
